ðŸ§  Sumo AI â€” Custom PPO Reinforcement Learning for Unity Battle Bots

This project trains Unity-based sumo bots to fight in a circular arena using a custom Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation.
Agents learn entirely through trial and error to push opponents out of the ring, maintain balance, and adapt to dynamic enemy behavior.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Details

Built a custom Python PPO trainer communicating with Unity via WebSockets

Designed an extensible multi-agent training loop for competitive reinforcement learning

Implemented custom reward shaping for aggression, positional control, and survival

Demonstrated emergent strategies such as flanking, countering, and sustained pushing

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

Unity â€¢ Python â€¢ PyTorch â€¢ WebSockets â€¢ Reinforcement Learning â€¢ PPO

ðŸš€ Goal

To explore emergent competitive behavior in adversarial RL by integrating a Unity physics simulation with a custom deep learning backend.
